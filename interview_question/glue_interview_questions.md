This approach reduces data duplication and ensures efficient processing of only the necessary data.

- **Incremental Processing**: Glue will not reprocess data that has already been processed in previous job runs, avoiding unnecessary costs and optimizing performance.

**Example**: Incremental processing using Glue job bookmarks.
```python
# Using job bookmarks to process only new data
dynamic_frame = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(
    database="my_database",
    table_name="my_table",
    transformation_ctx="dynamic_frame"
)
```

**211. What is the difference between a DynamicFrame and a DataFrame in AWS Glue?**

**Answer:**
In AWS Glue, both **DynamicFrame** and **DataFrame** are used to represent distributed datasets, but they differ in how they handle data:

1. **DynamicFrame**: A specialized data structure used by AWS Glue that is schema-flexible and supports working with semi-structured data (like JSON, Parquet, and XML). It allows you to perform schema evolution and transformation directly without needing to convert the data into a predefined schema.
   
   - More flexible and can handle unstructured/semi-structured data.
   - Provides Glue-specific transformations, such as **ApplyMapping**, **Relationalize**, etc.

2. **DataFrame**: A general Spark data structure that is part of the **Spark SQL** library. It requires a predefined schema and is more structured than a DynamicFrame. It is ideal for structured data processing.

   - Typically used when working with structured data.
   - Allows you to run Spark SQL queries.

**Example**:
```python
# Converting a DynamicFrame to DataFrame for SQL processing
data_frame = dynamic_frame.toDF()

# Perform SQL query on the DataFrame
data_frame.createOrReplaceTempView("my_table")
result = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE age > 30")
```
