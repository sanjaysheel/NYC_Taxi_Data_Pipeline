### Easy Mode Questions

1. **What is AWS Glue and what are its main components?**
   - **Answer:** AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service that makes it easy to prepare and load data for analytics. Its main components are the Data Catalog, Crawlers, and Jobs.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```python
     import boto3
     glue = boto3.client('glue')
     response = glue.get_jobs()
     print(response)
     ```

2. **How does AWS Glue integrate with Apache Spark?**
   - **Answer:** AWS Glue uses a specialized GlueContext, which is an extension of SparkContext, to work with data in AWS Glue. It allows the use of DynamicFrames for optimized ETL operations and integrates seamlessly with the Glue Data Catalog and other Glue services.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```python
     from pyspark.context import SparkContext
     from awsglue.context import GlueContext

     sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()
     glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
     spark = glueContext.spark_session
     ```

3. **What is a Glue Data Catalog and how is it used?**
   - **Answer:** The Glue Data Catalog is a centralized metadata repository that stores information about data sources. It helps in organizing and managing metadata for datasets, making it easier to discover, manage, and query the data using AWS Glue, Apache Spark, and other AWS services.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```python
     import boto3
     glue = boto3.client('glue')
     response = glue.get_databases()

   - **Example Code:**
     ```python
     from awsglue.context import GlueContext
     glueContext = GlueContext(SparkContext.getOrCreate())

     dynamic_frame = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(
         database="my_database", 
         table_name="my_table"
     )
     dynamic_frame.printSchema()
     ```

7. **What is a Glue DynamicFrame and how does it differ from a Spark DataFrame?**
   - **Answer:** A Glue DynamicFrame is a distributed collection of data, similar to a Spark DataFrame, which is optimized for ETL operations.

### Advanced Questions

110. **How do you optimize joins in Spark using broadcast variables?**
    - **Answer:** Optimize joins using broadcast variables in Spark by broadcasting a small DataFrame to all worker nodes. This allows each node to perform the join locally without shuffling large amounts of data, improving join performance.
    - **Example Code:**
      ```python
      from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
      from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

      spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MyApp").getOrCreate()
      df_large = spark.read.csv("s3://large-dataset/")
      df_small = spark.read.csv("s3://small-dataset/")

      joined_df = df_large.join(broadcast(df_small), "key")
      joined_df.show()
      ```

111. **Explain the concept of fault tolerance in Spark.**
    - **Answer:** Fault tolerance in Spark ensures that the system can recover from failures and continue processing data. It is achieved through:
      - **RDD Lineage:** Spark maintains the lineage of RDDs, allowing it to recompute lost partitions in case of a failure.
      - **Checkpointing:** Persisting intermediate results to reliable storage, enabling faster recovery.
    - **Example Code:**
      ```python
      from pyspark import SparkContext

      sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()
      rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
      rdd = rdd.checkpoint()
      rdd.collect()
      ```

112. **How do you implement streaming data processing in Spark?**
    - **Answer:** Implement streaming data processing in Spark using Spark Structured Streaming. It provides a unified API for batch and streaming data processing.

      from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

      spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MyApp").getOrCreate()
      df = spark.readStream.format("socket").option("host", "localhost").option("port", 9999).load()

      query = df.writeStream.outputMode("append").format("console").start()
      query.awaitTermination()
      ```

113. **Discuss the role of the Spark SQL Catalyst optimizer.**
    - **Answer:** The Catalyst optimizer is a query optimization framework in Spark SQL. It automatically optimizes query plans by applying rule-based and cost-based optimizations, improving query performance.

      ```python
      from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

      spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MyApp").getOrCreate()
      df = spark.read.csv("s3://my-data/")
      df.createOrReplaceTempView("table")
      
      # The Catalyst optimizer automatically optimizes the following query
      result = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM table WHERE value > 100")
      result.show()

     ```

119. **Explain the concept of accumulator variables in Spark.**
   - **Answer:** Accumulator variables in Spark are used for aggregating information across the nodes in a cluster. They allow you to perform global counters and sums in a parallel environment.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```python
     from pyspark import SparkContext

     sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()
     accumulator = sc.accumulator(0)
